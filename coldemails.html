    <h2>Debunking Common Myths About Cold Emailing Professors</h2>
    <p>
      Cold emailing professors is often misunderstood. Many believe it's just spam, that only salespeople use it, or that it rarely works. In reality, cold emailing—when done thoughtfully and respectfully—can open doors to research opportunities, mentorship, and academic collaboration.<br><br>
      <strong>Myth 1:</strong> Cold emails are always spam.<br>
      <strong>Fact:</strong> Personalized, well-researched emails that show genuine interest are not spam and are a common way for students to initiate academic connections.<br><br>
      <strong>Myth 2:</strong> Professors never respond to cold emails.<br>
      <strong>Fact:</strong> While professors are busy and may not reply to every message, many do respond to well-crafted emails, especially those that demonstrate specific interest in their work.<br><br>
      <strong>Myth 3:</strong> Cold emailing is inappropriate.<br>
      <strong>Fact:</strong> Reaching out is an accepted practice in academia, as long as the approach is polite, concise, and relevant.<br><br>
      The key is to avoid generic messages and to show that you've done your homework. Below, you'll find a curated list of resources—including those with sample templates—to help you write effective cold emails that stand out for the right reasons.
