  <h1>LaTeX for Research</h1>
  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      <strong>Why is typesetting important in research?</strong><br>
      Effective research communication depends on clear, consistent, and professional document formatting. Good typesetting ensures that your ideas, data, and equations are presented accurately and are easy to understand, which is crucial for peer review, publication, and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How does LaTeX factor into it?</strong><br>
      LaTeX is the gold standard for academic typesetting, especially in science, engineering, and mathematics. It gives researchers precise control over document structure, references, and mathematical notation, producing publication-ready results and streamlining the writing process for complex documents.

    <h2>My LaTeX Journey: From Pen & Paper to Digital Typesetting</h2>
    <p>
      I’ll be honest: I’ve always been a pen and paper person. Anything that remotely resembled programming used to send me running in the opposite direction! But after a simple observation in my own research workflow, I realized just how much time and effort could be saved—and how much more professional my work could look—with the right typesetting tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s why, despite my initial hesitation, I dove into LaTeX and ended up writing three guides tailored to my fields of study. If you’re someone who prefers scribbling notes in the margins or feels intimidated by code, you’re not alone! My guides are written with you in mind: practical, approachable, and focused on real research needs.
