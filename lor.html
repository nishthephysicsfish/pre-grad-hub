    <h2>A Personal Story: The Subtle Art of Being Seen</h2>
    <p>
      Not all great letters of recommendation come from persistent annoyance—constantly asking your professor endless questions, even when you already know the answer. You don't need to try so hard to be seen. Yes, it's important to get good test scores, but sometimes, asking something as simple as, <em>"How did you end up studying this?"</em> or <em>"What's the best part about teaching and conducting research?"</em> can give you an absolutely exquisite standing amongst your peers. Genuine curiosity and authentic engagement often leave a more lasting impression than forced interactions.
