  <h1>Securing Great Letters of Recommendation</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <h2>A Personal Story: The Subtle Art of Being Seen</h2>
    <p>
      Not all great letters of recommendation come from persistent annoyance—constantly asking your professor endless questions, even when you already know the answer. You don't need to try so hard to be seen. Yes, it's important to get good test scores, but sometimes, asking something as simple as, <em>"How did you end up studying this?"</em> or <em>"What's the best part about teaching and conducting research?"</em> can give you an absolutely exquisite standing amongst your peers. Genuine curiosity and authentic engagement often leave a more lasting impression than forced interactions.

    <h2>What If a Professor Asks You to Write Your Own Letter of Recommendation?</h2>
    <p>
      It might feel intimidating or even awkward if a professor asks you to draft your own letter of recommendation for them to review and sign. But there’s a silver lining: you are the best advocate for your own achievements! This is your chance to highlight your strengths, experiences, and growth in a way that is both organized and compelling.
