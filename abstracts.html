            <h3>STEM (Engineering)</h3>
            <div class="abstract-text">
                This study presents the design and testing of a low-cost, solar-powered water purification system for rural communities. The system utilizes a photovoltaic panel to power a membrane filtration unit, removing contaminants from groundwater. Field tests in three villages demonstrated a 99% reduction in bacterial content and significant improvements in water clarity and taste. The results suggest that this technology can provide a sustainable solution for clean water access in resource-limited settings.

            <h3>Psychology</h3>
            <div class="abstract-text">
                The present study examined the relationship between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in college students. A sample of 310 students completed validated measures of perfectionism and psychological symptoms. Results indicated that maladaptive perfectionism was positively correlated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas adaptive perfectionism showed no significant association with these symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of differentiating between perfectionism subtypes in mental health assessments.<br>

                Background: Early detection of sepsis is critical for reducing mortality rates in hospitalized patients. This retrospective cohort study analyzed the effectiveness of a machine learning algorithm in predicting sepsis onset using electronic health record data from 5,000 adult patients. The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89, outperforming traditional scoring systems. Implementation of the algorithm in clinical practice could facilitate timely intervention and improve patient outcomes.

            <h3>Arts</h3>
            <div class="abstract-text">
                This paper explores the evolution of public mural art in urban spaces from 1970 to 2020, focusing on the role of community engagement in shaping artistic themes. Through qualitative analysis of 50 murals and interviews with artists and residents, the study identifies recurring motifs of social justice and cultural identity. The findings highlight how collaborative art practices foster civic pride and dialogue, suggesting new directions for public art policy.

            <div class="abstract-text">
                This thesis analyzes representations of exile in twentieth-century Latin American literature, with a focus on novels by Gabriel García Márquez and Isabel Allende. Using close reading and comparative analysis, the research uncovers how narrative strategies evoke themes of displacement, memory, and identity. The study concludes that literary depictions of exile serve as a powerful lens for understanding broader socio-political dynamics in the region.
