            <div class="abstract-text">
                This paper investigates the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a class of nonlinear partial differential equations arising in fluid dynamics. Using the method of upper and lower solutions combined with fixed point theorems, we establish new criteria for the global existence of smooth solutions under minimal regularity assumptions. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the sharpness of our theoretical results and to demonstrate the stability of solutions under various initial conditions. Our findings extend previous work on the Navier-Stokes equations and offer insights into the mathematical modeling of turbulent flows, with potential applications in both engineering and atmospheric science.<br>

                We present experimental and theoretical investigations of the quantum behavior of a non-Hermitian qubit constructed from a dissipative superconducting transmon circuit. Using microwave spectroscopy and time-resolved measurements, we observe signatures of exceptional points and non-reciprocal state evolution, consistent with predictions from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Our results demonstrate robust control over the system's eigenstates and highlight the potential for engineering non-Hermitian effects in quantum information platforms. These findings open new avenues for exploring topological phenomena and decoherence mitigation in superconducting quantum circuits.<br>

                The development of efficient catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction is a major goal in sustainable chemistry. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel cobalt-based molecular catalyst for electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Cyclic voltammetry and controlled-potential electrolysis reveal high selectivity toward CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% under mild conditions. Spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations suggest that the catalyst operates via a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism, with a key intermediate stabilized by hydrogen bonding. Our results provide valuable insights into catalyst design for artificial photosynthesis and contribute to the broader effort to mitigate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.<br>

                Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation in natural populations is a central question in evolutionary biology. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing to investigate patterns of genetic variation in wild populations of <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> across a latitudinal gradient. Population genomic analyses identify several loci under strong positive selection, many of which are associated with thermal tolerance and metabolic regulation. Functional assays confirm that allelic variants at these loci confer increased survival at temperature extremes. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms of environmental adaptation and provide a framework for predicting evolutionary responses to climate change.<br>

                Access to clean water remains a critical challenge in rural and developing regions. This paper details the design, implementation, and field evaluation of a low-cost, solar-powered water purification system intended for deployment in off-grid communities. The system employs photovoltaic panels to drive a membrane filtration unit, effectively removing microbial and chemical contaminants from groundwater sources. Over a six-month pilot study in three rural villages in Kenya, the system processed an average of 1,500 liters per day, achieving a 99.8% reduction in E. coli and a 97% decrease in turbidity. User surveys indicated high satisfaction with water taste and clarity, and maintenance requirements were minimal. The study concludes that solar-powered filtration systems offer a sustainable, scalable solution for improving public health and quality of life in resource-limited settings, and recommends further research into long-term durability and cost optimization.<br>

            <h3>Psychology</h3>
            <div class="abstract-text">
                Perfectionism has been linked to a range of psychological outcomes, yet the distinction between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism remains underexplored in collegiate populations. This study surveyed 310 undergraduate students using the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) to examine how perfectionism subtypes relate to mental health. Results revealed that maladaptive perfectionism, characterized by excessive concern over mistakes and doubts about actions, was significantly associated with higher scores on depression, anxiety, and stress. In contrast, adaptive perfectionism, defined by high personal standards and organization, showed no significant relationship with negative psychological outcomes. The findings underscore the necessity for mental health practitioners to differentiate between perfectionism subtypes when assessing risk and designing interventions for student populations. Implications for campus counseling services and future research directions are discussed.<br>

                Background: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in hospitalized patients, and early detection is crucial for improving outcomes. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the performance of a machine learning algorithm designed to predict sepsis onset using real-time electronic health record (EHR) data. Data from 5,000 adult inpatients at a tertiary care hospital were analyzed, with the algorithm incorporating over 40 clinical variables, including vital signs, laboratory results, and demographics. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.89, significantly outperforming the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Implementation of the algorithm in a simulated clinical workflow resulted in a 20% increase in timely sepsis interventions. These findings suggest that machine learning-based prediction tools can enhance early sepsis identification and have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in hospital settings.<br>

                This paper investigates the transformation of public mural art in urban environments from 1970 to 2020, emphasizing the role of community engagement in shaping artistic narratives. Through a qualitative analysis of 50 murals across five metropolitan cities, complemented by in-depth interviews with 20 artists and 30 community members, the study identifies recurring motifs of social justice, cultural identity, and collective memory. Findings reveal that participatory mural projects foster a sense of ownership and pride among residents, while also serving as catalysts for dialogue on pressing social issues. The research further explores how funding structures and municipal policies influence the sustainability and thematic direction of public art initiatives. The study concludes by offering policy recommendations to enhance community collaboration in future public art programs.<br>

                This thesis examines the representation of exile in twentieth-century Latin American literature, focusing on the novels of Gabriel García Márquez and Isabel Allende. Through close textual analysis and comparative literary frameworks, the research explores how both authors employ narrative strategies—such as magical realism, fragmented chronology, and shifting narrative voice—to evoke themes of displacement, memory, and identity reconstruction. The study situates these literary works within their historical and political contexts, arguing that the motif of exile serves as a powerful lens for interrogating national identity, resistance, and the legacy of authoritarian regimes. Ultimately, the thesis contends that literary depictions of exile not only reflect personal and collective trauma but also offer pathways for cultural renewal and transnational solidarity.<br>
